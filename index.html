    <h1>Welcome to James' About Me Page</h1>
    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">I am 35 years old and an aspiring programmer.  Currently I am living in Kirkland, Washington, though I have lived in many places in the US, including Alaska, Maine, Florida, Arizona and a few places in between.  After four years serving in the US Air Force, I decided to move up to the Seattle area and have been loving the area ever since.  In my free time (which has become rather rare lately) I like to read, play video games and guitar, take care of my cats and go for walks.</p>
